# 🚀 GitHub Repository Push Instructions

## ❗ IMPORTANT: Create Repository First

The error occurs because the GitHub repository doesn't exist yet. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `next-auth`
3. **Description**: `3-stage progressive frontend development interview case study`
4. **Visibility**: ✅ **Public** (as required by task)
5. **Initialize**: ❌ **Do NOT check any boxes** (we have our files ready)
6. **Click**: "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, you have two options:

#### Option A: Use the Script (Recommended)
```bash
./push-to-github.sh
```

#### Option B: Manual Commands
```bash
# Push main branch first
git checkout main
git push -u origin main

# Push Stage 1 development branch
git checkout dev/v1.0.0
git push -u origin dev/v1.0.0

# Push Stage 2 development branch
git checkout dev/v2.0.0
git push -u origin dev/v2.0.0

# Push Stage 3 development branch
git checkout dev/v3.0.0
git push -u origin dev/v3.0.0

# Return to Stage 1 for development
git checkout dev/v1.0.0
```

## ✅ Expected Result

After successful push, your GitHub repository will have:

```

## 🎯 Ready for Development

Once pushed, start development on Stage 1:

```bash
# Switch to Stage 1 development
git checkout dev/v1.0.0

# Navigate to Stage 1
cd stage1-auth

# Install dependencies (will be available after implementation)
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## 📋 Task Compliance

This setup follows the task requirements:
- ✅ **Public repository** named `next-auth`
- ✅ **dev/v1.0.0 branch** for Stage 1 development
- ✅ **Proper branch structure** for all stages
- ✅ **Foundation architecture** ready for implementation
- ✅ **Documentation** and development standards

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If you still get "Repository not found" error:
1. Verify the repository was created on GitHub
2. Check the repository is public
3. Ensure you're logged in to GitHub
4. Try: `git remote -v` to verify the URL is correct
5. If URL is wrong, update it: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/erolkuluslu/next-auth.git`
